<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Hi! I'm Mariana</h2>

<p>I'm a very social funny person that enjoys coding and techies and also sports a lot. I live by the ocean and I really need to feel that salty breeze in my daily life. Nature and music are essential for this human being!</p>

<p>On the professional side of my life I'm building a web developer career, doing something that gives me joy and getting my money out of it sounds great to me!<br/>
  I was once a biomedical engeneering student in Coimbra, the portuguese Hogwarts, and that was an amazing and essential part of my education, it helped me figuring out where I wanted to be and how to build my own path in life.
